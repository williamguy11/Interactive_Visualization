    An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?

Suicide deaths are difficult to make sense of for those left behind.  In the U.S., 1.6 million Americans attempted suicide in 2022 (CDC).  We were curious if this is an increase from historical suicide death rates.  After examining suicide death rates we wanted to understand the trend over the time period of available data.  In order to easily visualize suicide death rates across the years, a line plot seemed like a logical choice.  
After some research, it was discovered that males have the highest suicide death rates.  We were curious what other demographics had a significant impact on suicide death rates. We decided to examine race, gender, ethnicity, and age to determine which groups are most at risk of suicide deaths.  In order to effectively display the suicide death rates of many different groups, we needed a way to visualize them together, compare them to the baseline of everyone in the U.S., and also drill down to examine each group individually.  After reviewing several different graphs, we found a line plot that enabled us to view the each group individually by highlighting and labeling it, view all the groups together, and point out the baseline by using a different color.
