# Interactive_Visualization
Your deployed web page should also include a write-up with the following components:

    A rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

    An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?

Suicide deaths are difficult to make sense of for those left behind.  In the U.S., 1.6 million Americans attempted suicide in 2022 (CDC).  We were curious if this is an increase from historical suicide death rates.  After examining suicide death rates we wanted to understand the trend over the time period of available data.  In order to easily visualize suicide death rates across the years, a line plot seemed like a logical choice.  
After some research, it was discovered that males have the highest suicide death rates.  We were curious what other demographics had a significant impact on suicide death rates. We decided to examine race, gender, ethnicity, and age to determine which groups are most at risk of suicide deaths.  In order to effectively display the suicide death rates of many different groups, we needed a way to visualize them together, compare them to the baseline of everyone in the U.S., and also drill down to examine each group individually.  After reviewing several different graphs, we found a line plot that enabled us to view the each group individually by highlighting and labeling it, view all the groups together, and point out the baseline by using a different color.  

We chose our particular visual encodings and interaction techniques by whatever made sense from a viewer's standpoint. Instead of including a legend describing each of the various demographics included in the visualization, we made it so the viewer could hover with their mouse over a particular plotted line, and the category (sex, race, age range) would be listed. We decided on the plot's color scheme to follow a blue line for every category except the "All Persons" which we encoded as red, since this reflects the mean rate of suicides over all people, and serves as a reference line to the rest. 
    
Our development process started with Exploratory Data Analysis, in which Caroline and Filina created a Jupyter Notebook, imported and cleaned the dataset. There were a few missing entries, so Caroline's approach was to average out the values in order to fill in missing/NA values. Filina helped to spot the various coding erros that were popping up (we had a lot of variable naming issues that had to be worked out) until we arrived at the finalized csv file. Once we had an idea of the visualization we wanted to create after performing initial EDA in a Jupyter Notebook environment, we moved to Observable in D3 to create our interactive visualization. This data cleaning and preprocessing step took up a large portion of our time - approximately 5 hours on call with each other. William's task was to import the cleaned data into Observable, plot and create an interactive mouse hover with Java Script, in which the user can hover over each of the plotted lines to see the specific category (male, female, race, age range etc) that is being plotted. This took him approximately 3 hours over two consecutive days, 6 in total. The final steps we took were to finalize the visualization by improving the chart labels, title and font size, as well as axis scaling - contributed by all members, approximately 1 hour. In total, the project took around 10 hours, with the data preprocessing and preparation taking a little over half of the time, and the actual execution of our visualization taking up the rest of the time.
